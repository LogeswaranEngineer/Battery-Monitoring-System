Designed a battery monitoring system using ESP8266, TP4056, and DHT22, programmed in C to measure voltage, temperature, and charging status with real-time display on OLED and Arduino Cloud integration via HTTP and MQTT protocols.
Implemented analog signal acquisition through voltage divider, sensor interfacing using I2C and digital protocols, and cloud communication using Wi-Fi with focus on low-power embedded system design and IoT connectivity.
